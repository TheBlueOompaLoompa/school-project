## Culture

Culture is a fancy term for mold... Wait. No. Culture is an abritrary category we
put people into based on their interests, herritage, possesions, and much much more. We use culture as a way to identify ourselves, and identify others.

## Characteristics

#### Reinventing the Wheel

Even though it doesn't make sense, programmers often try to create their own version of something even though it doesnt make any sense to. As an example, this website, there were many much easier ways for me to create this website but I chose to make it from scratch because I wanted to make it my own.

#### Persistent

Programming is often very frustrating, spending hours trying to fix one thing, only to realize you forgot a semicolon.

#### Adaptive

The world of technology is constantly changing. This means developers have to constantly adapt too.
