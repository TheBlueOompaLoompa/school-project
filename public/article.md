# Prerequisites

I will use some words inter-changably. These words are developer, coder, programmer. I will also use coding, programming, and developing. Just know these words essentially mean the same thing.

## Culture

Culture is a fancy term for mold... Wait. No. Culture is an abritrary category we
put people into based on their interests, herritage, possesions, and much much more. We use culture as a way to identify ourselves, and identify others.

## Characteristics

#### Reinventing the Wheel

Even though it doesn't make sense, programmers often try to create their own version of something even though it doesnt make any sense to. As an example, this website, there were many much easier ways for me to create this website but I chose to make it from scratch because I wanted to make it my own.

#### Persistent

Programming is often very frustrating, spending hours trying to fix one thing, only to realize you forgot a semicolon.

#### Adaptive

The world of technology is constantly changing. This means developers have to constantly adapt too.

## About Me

I am a software developer myself. I spend my time experimenting and just generally trying to see what I can do with code.

## Similarites to Others

There is crossover with hackers as most hackers are programmers. Many programmers are also people who play video games on a computer. Any job that mainly involves computers has that similarity. Other than that it's up to the individual to what they do.

## Stereotypes and Conflicts

#### Conflicts

There is often a problem with developers called crunch time. Crunch time is when a project is about to launch so everyone is scrambling and working long hours to launch something. This often disregrards developers personal time and health.

#### Stereotypes

There are many stereotypes that extist, but here are a few.

1. The basement dwelling hermit - This is the most accurate out of all the stereotypes.

2. Neckbeard - Idk this is just something that some call people who obsess over something and don't maintain their health, hence the neckbeard.

3. Techno Wizzards - This is pretty much true for the most part.

4. Everyone's a hacker - This is the most common. When many people see a screen like

![Monitor Picture](/Untitled.svg)

their mind often instantly jumps to the Hollywood hacker, `clack clack clack "I'm in."` At this point I have no idea if people actually think this is accurate or it's just a joke _(I really hope it's a joke)_ our screens may look like this, but really they are probably trying to find out why something was green instead of blue.

##### Credits

Since this is public I would like to keep my identity anonymous, people in my class can identify me from the spreadsheet, or by the fact that I wear my bright pink watch almost every day.
